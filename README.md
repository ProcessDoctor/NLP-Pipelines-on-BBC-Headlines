# NLP-Pipelines-on-BBC-Headlines
Developed a complete NLP pipeline to preprocess, tokenize, lemmatize, and analyze BBC news headlines using Python libraries like spaCy, NLTK, and pandas. Performed Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging and Named Entity Recognition (NER), and visualized the frequency of common nouns, verbs, adjectives, and named entities.
